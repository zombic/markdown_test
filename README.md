# Tired
Today, accurately recently, I am very tired.
That may be cause to my mutiple work. I am working on node.js framwork to a platform to NetDragon game server.
- Node.js
I never formally working on JavaScript, and Node.js is more complex than usually JavaScript.
- React and Redux
That is new web framework, you know I never did web develope work. So many Js/Jsx language make me confuse. And I am strange to HTML and CSS.
- PHP with laravel
This PHP structure include many components like composer, Node.js, Vagrant, and Laravel itself are much stranger to me.
- Confusing Code
Reading and understanding other people's code is a difficult job. Expecially when the author is not a good coder with comments and great language usage.

# Wierd work environment
NetDragon office is open. Somebody always speak loud just like nobody could mind. They usually work __all night__ and make you normal day work is stranger. Unfortunately they never give you any tip or any help.
No code comments here. No documents here. Even no entire require documents here.
Many rules control your mind, time and act. It make me terrible.
# Test markdown syntax
I don't want to be a coder! No more `void main()`!

 echo 'fuck every body!';
